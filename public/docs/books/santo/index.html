<blockquote>
<p>A skeletal figure, draped in a purple robe, stands behind a market stall filled with jars and containers of various goods. The figure&rsquo;s bony hand gestures towards the merchandise, suggesting a merchant or vendor. The setting appears to be an open-air marketplace with a simple cloth awning providing shade. The title, &ldquo;Santo,&rdquo; is prominently displayed in a stylized, gray font with a slight drop shadow, giving it a whimsical yet slightly eerie feel. Below the title, the tagline &ldquo;Rattle &amp; Craft - An Isekai LitRPG of Bones and Business&rdquo; is presented in a clean, white, sans-serif font, offering insight into the story&rsquo;s theme and genre, blending fantasy with entrepreneurial elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Book Description:</p>
<p>Santo was just your average office worker, drowning in spreadsheets and yearning for a life less ordinary. Then, a fateful accident grants his wish, but with a skeletal twist! Reborn as a lowly skeleton in a fantastical world, Santo despairs until he discovers a peculiar skill – the ability to animate objects with a touch of necromantic energy.</p>
<p>Armed with this unusual skill, Santo embarks on a journey as a wandering merchant, crafting quirky companions and enchanted tools to sell across the land. Along the way, he encounters curious creatures, unravels the mysteries of his skeletal existence, and learns that even a bag of bones can build a thriving business… and maybe even find friendship in this strange new world.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1---skeletons-and-surprises">Chapter 1 - Skeletons and Surprises <a href="#chapter-1---skeletons-and-surprises" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>Santo woke up in the morning, resting against his neat pillow, trying to stretch himself up out of bed. His sleep was mysteriously glorious, so he got this weird surreality after a good night&rsquo;s sleep like he was lost and didn&rsquo;t belong here. His dreams had been long and vivid, and now he was here sitting up on his bed.</p>
<p>He went to take a shower, never underestimating the power of a good cold bath. It had been years since he got a good cold bath after a good cold sleep.</p>
<p>Waking up with that extra coldness made it difficult to take a good cold bath, but it was extra good.</p>
<p>Everything was going to be great—the better word after good.</p>
<p>He went to work in his living room, waking up his gaming computer and just typing immediately since he left it on the source-code editor application he used last night.</p>
<p>Relaxed, he tried resting his eyes after he tried pushing for a new personal project that really challenged his thinking. But he couldn&rsquo;t do it while sitting on a chair in front of a screen.</p>
<p>He drank some good water and fell asleep.</p>
<p>When he woke up, he found himself inside a room with soft walls similar to those in a large church. It was air-conditioned too. It looked like a fancier place to have a conference.</p>
<p>He noticed the only door in the room opening, making him jolt back.</p>
<p>The figure he came looked at him, staring for a while before tilting his head at the people behind him. It was a man wearing a brown jacket and red trousers. He said: &ldquo;Hey guys, he&rsquo;s awake. How do you guys even get people like these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo then fell unconscious, and then he found himself on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he said, noticing the tropical rainforest all around him. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; His face accidentally brushed against vegetation, getting tickled and surprised.</p>
<p>He felt slightly nauseous, but it quickly faded, as if someone magically healed him.</p>
<p>He looked around and kept walking, finding himself at a river. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t&hellip; Where is it?&rdquo; He was looking for a road.</p>
<p>He found a road. &ldquo;There. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t actually a road. It just looked like it. &ldquo;Dang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rubbed his mouth, as a wandering adventurer party emerged, sighting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; he mouthed and then repeated it in a loud voice.</p>
<p>The party noticed and asked why.</p>
<p>Santo felt he didn&rsquo;t know how to speak due to shock, but he tried anyway: &ldquo;Where am I right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party glanced at each other and approached him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re at Masu,&rdquo; one of them said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masu? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; what&rsquo;s Masu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masu is here. You&rsquo;re at Masu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masu&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, sorry. I suddenly appeared here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly? Did you go here through a portal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? I think so. Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you must be from the farther regions. The portals don&rsquo;t reach this far anymore usually, because there&rsquo;s really nothing around here for them. You&rsquo;re at the beginning towns. There&rsquo;s a journey you&rsquo;re supposed to follow, so why are you here? Don&rsquo;t you live there, and if not, haven&rsquo;t you already gone past this point? You&rsquo;re regressing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo shook his head. &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t&hellip; know what you mean&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be. Be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo nodded pregnantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can follow us. Come, come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party led the way and showed him to the nearby village.</p>
<p>Santo noticed something shocking. His fingers were slowly dripping away, the tips of which showed bones. What did this mean?</p>
<p>His body suddenly turned to a skeleton, and he teleported away to an underground dungeon.</p>
<p><strong>[You have successfully evolved into a lowly skeleton! You were moved to the dungeon! Check your stats!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Evolution has made you weak! You get Evolution weakness, reducing your Max Health by 50!]</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But why am I here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>He scratched his head.</p>
<p>He tried moving his arms and found it horrid. The experience of moving bones replacing his functional human limbs could be likened to living inside of a painting or dream for extended periods of time. And some of those dreams were scary.</p>
<p>He began walking.</p>
<p>Inside the cave, he had little to do with anything. It was empty and dark, and he could barely see. He didn&rsquo;t even know how to navigate it, because it was so complex. Real dungeons were very wide, high, and cavernous that any loud movement would echo throughout. This was why he heard so many monsters right now.</p>
<p>He sighed and distracted himself by tapping his bones together. &ldquo;What to do&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>He picked up a rock and threw it.</p>
<p><strong>[You have killed a goblin! +10 XP!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Level 0 -&gt; Level 1!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Level 1: 0/15]</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; He tried to do what he was told earlier, checking his stats.</p>

<p>He added his stat points to [Strength], not knowing what else to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>[As a result of your newfound Strength, your Attack Damage has increased: 0.5 - 1.5!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Your sudden spike in Strength has made you weakened. You have been affected by Strength Excess, which reduces your Attack Damage by 50% for 5 minutes!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[As a result of Strength Excess, your Attack Damage has decreased: 0 - 1!]</strong></p>
<p>He began noticing a holographic health bar every time he struck a rock, noticing the rock breaking faster every time he hit it.</p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 24.5/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 24/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 23.5/25]</strong></p>
<p>The rock cracked slightly, but it kept its hard shell, only making a sound internally.</p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 22.5/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 22.5/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 22.5/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 22.5/25]</strong></p>
<p>This time, the rock was much more affected with open cracks along its middle.</p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 22/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 21/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 20/25]</strong></p>
<p>He pulled open the crack, breaking it apart.</p>
<p><strong>[Rock has become vulnerable, increasing all damage dealt to it by 500%]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Your Attack Damage to Rock has been increased: 0 - 5!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 17/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 17/25]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 3/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 2/25]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Rock: HP - 1/25]</strong></p>
<p>The rock exploded, leaving behind a scree of gravel.</p>
<p><strong>[You have gained a new progress bar! Miner]</strong></p>
<p>Santo smiled.</p>
<p>He tried smashing another rock.</p>
<p>And he did it again and again until he had enough to carry in one palm. It wasn&rsquo;t much really, but for now, it was good enough.</p>
<p>He brought them with him and walked away, passing by a group of skeletons who all looked a little confused at what this newbie was doing.</p>
<p>One of the skeletons said: &ldquo;Hey, brother man, might we ask what you&rsquo;re doing? Are you going to work as the hermit moles who take care of the food because the stones are used as fuel. Don&rsquo;t do that. Follow us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo nodded politely and dropped the rocks safely next to the cave wall.</p>
<p>The skeletons led him to a chamber where hundreds of monsters hanged out.</p>
<p>Santo widened his eyes before he relaxed.</p>
<p>Not a single goblin.</p>
<p>If one of the goblins was here, then him having killed the goblin would be disastrous.</p>
<p>He joined the skeletons in chuckling about something.</p>
<p>He had no idea what they were laughing about, but he was nervous.</p>
<p>He took his time for now.</p>
<p>The skeletons led him to a table where they sat down, as one of the skeletons went to the counter.</p>
<p>This skeleton got plates and put food on them one by one for the rest of the group.</p>
<p>After he returned, Santo was starving somehow.</p>
<p>They began eating.</p>
<p>It was delicious food made from boring cows, but the dish was well-prepared.</p>
<p>It had cut onions, scallions, jalapeño, and beef all cooked separately and then added together in the final result.</p>
<p>The smell made him wrinkle his nose several times in desperation.</p>
<p>When he ate it, his stomach noticed a change.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t notice it earlier, but he got a Miner progress bar.</p>
<p>While the skeletons left, he was left to explore on his own.</p>
<p>He explored finding three different chambers.</p>
<p>He entered them one by one.</p>
<p>One was a big library with cobwebs.</p>
<p>Second was a tall underground tower.</p>
<p>Third was a large waterfall that led to large tunnels.</p>
<p>After checking them all, he returned to the library, grabbing one of the books.</p>
<p><strong>[This book contains the skill Animate Object. Take it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Since this is your first skill, do you want a tutorial?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[First, meditate. Second, release with a deep exhale. Third, raise your hand and aim it at your target.]</strong></p>
<p>Santo tried it, raising his hand first and then meditating and releasing with a deep exhale.</p>
<p><strong>[Animate Object has been cast!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Animate Object hits Book!]</strong></p>
<p>The book he hit got up on its own and looked at Santo.</p>
<p>Santo glanced around. &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The book shook his head and began opening its pages, showing him information about being a wandering merchant.</p>
<p>Santo read it and got interested. &ldquo;This is&hellip; How do I do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book shook as if shrugging.</p>
<p>Santo realized that it meant that he had to be the one to find out himself.</p>
<p>He left and went up a flight of stairs in the common floor.</p>
<p><strong>[This staircase has been imbued with necromantic energy. It empowers you with Staircase&rsquo;s Knowledge, which gives you +1 Intelligence for 1 minute!]</strong></p>
<p>He kept going, finding a large gate.</p>
<p>He opened up.</p>
<p><strong>[Your level is too low to pass through here. Wait until you&rsquo;ve leveled up.]</strong></p>
<p>He went back down and looked for another way.</p>
<p>He found a tunnel that led to a small door.</p>
<p>The door opened by itself.</p>
<p>A group of skeletons were standing inside an underground dungeon kitchen, cooking.</p>
<p>Santo excused himself and left.</p>
<p>He went to another area and found only a group of goblins beating a skeleton.</p>
<p>He kept looking and looking.</p>
<p>But he couldn&rsquo;t find the exit.</p>
<p>He realized that it would take a while before he would get out of here, so he sat down.</p>
<p><strong>[You are relaxed. Gained 1+ XP]</strong></p>
<p>He realized that even idle actions gave me XP.</p>
<p>He wondered what else.</p>
<p>He tried doing jumping jacks, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>He tried running up and down the flight of steps again and again.</p>
<p><strong>[This staircase is troubled. It weakens you with Troubled Steps, which takes away +1 Intelligence for 1 minute!]</strong></p>
<p>He stopped, feeling exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>[You are tired. Get some rest. You have 5 minutes until you are forcibly made to fall asleep.]</strong></p>
<p>He lay down, passing out before the timer hit 4 minutes.</p>
<p>When he woke up, he felt relaxed.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t get the reward notification.</p>
<p>He kept looking around, seeing the shadows of a group of adventurers, including a wizard.</p>
<p>After the adventurers left, he went along the path whence they came, finally reaching the surface.</p>
<p>Before doing so, he cautiously went to the library and got the book before leaving; though, he quickly rummaged the library for more books.</p>
<p><strong>[This book contains the skill Crafting. Take it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Your limit is one skill. Rejecting skill.</strong>]**</p>
<p><strong>[Book wants to be your list of skills. Take the offer?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Book will contain the rest of your skills. It will now be your physical library of skills.]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]</strong></p>
<p>Then, he left the dungeon, reaching the surface, sighting a town.</p>
<p>The book in his grasp looked onward excitedly.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2---merchant-and-skill-exploring-1">Chapter 2 - Merchant and Skill Exploring 1 <a href="#chapter-2---merchant-and-skill-exploring-1" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>When Santo reached the town, he wondered how he could blend in, looking at the nature around him.</p>
<p>The beautiful rippling grass flowed like gentle leaf-shaped magic particles upon a fairy&rsquo;s wings, their tips like golden hymns in their waving motion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the lone wizard from the adventurer party he saw earlier noticed him, casting: &ldquo;[No Man Nor Beast Shall Ever Through These Lands Ever Again]!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo was surprised, protecting his head, neck, and his face.</p>
<p>However, when the wizard&rsquo;s skill finally hit him, nothing happened. Santo wasn&rsquo;t a man or a beast like it said on the spell&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brown stuff!&rdquo; the wizard cursed. &ldquo;Wrong skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Santo could understand what was going on, the wizard cast another skill: &ldquo;[Lightning strike!]&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[Lightning strike has dealt 0 damage due to the skeleton&rsquo;s 100% Lightning resistance]</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast it!&rdquo; the wizard cursed again.</p>
<p>He looked for his items.</p>
<p>Since the wizard took his time, Santo didn&rsquo;t feel pressured at all. Though, since his life might be in future danger, he walked up and knocked him unconscious.</p>
<p>The wizard fell to the ground, his eyes spiraling with unconsciousness.</p>
<p><strong>[The wizard will gain consciousness in 72 seconds.]</strong></p>
<p>Well, since the wizard tried to kill him, Santo felt that it wouldn&rsquo;t be too troublesome for him to take his stuff. Keepers peace-keepers, or something like that. He was actually referring to finders keepers, but whatever.</p>
<p><strong>[This book contains the skill Disguise. Take it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This book contains the skill Lightning strike. Take it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This ancient scroll contains the skill Herbalism. Study it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This enchanted ring contains the skill Animal Communication. Wear it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This mysterious potion contains the skill Night Vision. Drink it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This old tome contains the skill Lockpicking. Read it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]</strong></p>
<p>When the wizard awakened, Santo was long gone, having went into the heart of the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; the wizard swore, scratching his head, looking around in distress.</p>
<p>Where would he get his next spell now!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Santo approached the town, using his two skills.</p>
<p><strong>[Disguise activated]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Night vision activated]</strong></p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t take that long to activate, and they cost no mana, being permanently active. It was very simple like turning on an air-fryer or making a function in code.</p>
<p>At the village, he found that the town was mostly empty and weary, with little to no stalls around.</p>
<p>He wondered what the best thing to do here was, and from his many ideas, he thought it would be a cool idea to be a stall seller.</p>
<p>The idea [Mysterious Wandering Merchant] sounded like a cool path he could take. He was sure that there were titles like these because the book said so. He read it inside the book. Like it had actual words and stuff. The spell was often not even related to what was actually written. So he actually read it. It was cool. But he didn&rsquo;t know the words.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Imagine if it he could steal people&rsquo;s stuff while they weren&rsquo;t looking. Just kidding. He could be a mysterious thief. But he didn&rsquo;t like stealing.</p>
<p>Even though he was in his twenties, most of his life was easy and smooth, so he never really matured he felt. Everyone around him was so depressed and anxious, while he was just relaxing in his room coding silently like a good boy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a man walked up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have manners? Wear your sandals!&rdquo; He pointed like an Asian parent, placing his fingers against him.</p>
<p>Santo was surprised to see someone noticing his bare feet. He realized that the disguise didn&rsquo;t include clothes when it made him look human. He was still the naked skeleton but with a human body in the eyes of the man. That was awkward.</p>
<p>The good thing was he wasn&rsquo;t actually naked, or human-naked. He was skeleton-naked! That was even better!</p>
<p>He told the man: &ldquo;Where can I get these sandals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man abruptly shifted from tension to friendliness, leading the way to a shop. &ldquo;Here, Sir. This is free for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo was confused, but he followed him.</p>
<p><strong>[Accept Poor Man&rsquo;s Sandals?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p>The man said with a smile: &ldquo;Thank you for taking it. My daughter has been wanting to share her creation for a while now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled harder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man grinned almost maniacally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;End conversation,&rdquo; Santo said, hurrying away.</p>
<p>He mentally asked the [System] if he could change his sandals&rsquo; name.</p>
<p><strong>[Change Poor Man&rsquo;s Sandals&rsquo; name?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Pick a new name!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Crazy Man&rsquo;s Sandals.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Success. Poor Man&rsquo;s Sandals has been renamed to Crazy Man&rsquo;s Sandals!]</strong></p>
<p>As for where Santo had gone, he was sitting down in front of a large wagon at a small shelter from the rain.</p>
<p><strong>[Ride wagon?]</strong></p>
<p>He looked around and noticed no one was around.</p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You are not the owner. Are you sure?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p>He began riding it.</p>
<p><strong>[Because you are not the owner, this wagon will expire in 5 minutes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Since it&rsquo;s your first time riding, tutorial?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[To move forward, first kick the horses. To avoid obstacles, lean left and right, and the horses will automatically understand. Then, to stop, shout at the horses to stop. They will stop if you&rsquo;re loud enough.]</strong></p>
<p>He obeyed the instructions and drove along.</p>
<p><strong>[A man is in the way. Dodge immediately!]</strong></p>
<p>Someone was in the way he realized.</p>
<p><strong>[Strength Check Failed! Strength required: 30. Your Strength: 11.]</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang it, dang it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man got hit.</p>
<p>Santo got down and asked the man if he was okay.</p>
<p><strong>[Charisma Check Success! Charisma required: 6. Your Charisma: 6.]</strong></p>
<p>The man was okay, so he said: &ldquo;Where did you learn how to drive&hellip; Wait a minute! That&rsquo;s my wagon with that beautiful dent that I know so well! How dare you take it from me, you nut-brains rascal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He demanded Santo to compensate him by working under him.</p>
<p>Santo asked what he would do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will help me sell!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>[Merchant Albatross is offering you the job Merchant&rsquo;s Apprentice! Take it?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yes.]</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; said Merchant Albatross.</p>
<p>Santo followed, leaving behind the wagon.</p>
<p>Albatross glanced behind him before he was like: &ldquo;Oh shoot, I forgot my wagon. I&rsquo;ll pretend I was going this way anyway and get it, and then I&rsquo;ll get mad at this new employee to deflect the blame to him. I&rsquo;m so insecure, dang it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they rode the wagon, Albatross led them to a small shack nearby, putting down his stuff and setting up his shop by pulling a large drop-leaf table out and showcasing all his goods there.</p>
<p>People immediately dropped by and bought items from him, showing their deep love for the goods the merchant showed.</p>
<p>In response, Albatross grinned with a laugh.</p>
<p><strong>[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]</strong></p>
<p>Santo didn&rsquo;t understand it, but he thought it was fun.</p>
<p><strong>[The Customer wants to buy from you. Roll a dice to get a chance at getting them to buy! For context, it&rsquo;s between numbers 1 to 20. The higher the number, the higher the chance!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Roll.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You get 5.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Customer smiled politely before leaving.]</strong></p>
<p>He looked at Albatross, who crossed his arms in disappointment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you try again, but no more after that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo nodded.</p>
<p>Later, another customer again.</p>
<p><strong>[The Customer wants to buy from you. Roll a dice to get a chance at getting them to buy! For context, it&rsquo;s between numbers 1 to 20. The higher the number, the higher the chance!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Roll.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You get 14.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Customer clapped, grabbing your goods and taking them all. Merchant Albatross is impressed!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You have gained a new progress bar! Merchant Seller]</strong></p>
<p>Santo wanted to learn how to do it. He didn&rsquo;t like the rolling.</p>
<p>So he asked Albatross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here&rsquo;s how you do it. You first have to rely on a systematic method that combined a variety of&hellip;&rdquo; He kept talking and talking, but Santo couldn&rsquo;t follow.</p>
<p>Santo shrugged and told him he didn&rsquo;t understand. He decided to just roll.</p>
<p><strong>[The Customer wants to buy from you. Roll a dice to get a chance at getting them to buy! For context, it&rsquo;s between numbers 1 to 20. The higher the number, the higher the chance!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Roll.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You get 15!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Merchant Seller +0.5 XP!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Customer wants to buy from you. Roll a dice to get a chance at getting them to buy! For context, it&rsquo;s between numbers 1 to 20. The higher the number, the higher the chance!]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[You get 3!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Customer wants to buy from you. Roll a dice to get a chance at getting them to buy! For context, it&rsquo;s between numbers 1 to 20. The higher the number, the higher the chance!]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[You get 7!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Merchant Seller +0.5 XP!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Customer wants to buy from you. Roll a dice to get a chance at getting them to buy! For context, it&rsquo;s between numbers 1 to 20. The higher the number, the higher the chance!]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Roll.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You get 15!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Merchant Seller +0.5 XP!]</strong></p>
<p>In the end, he got 1.5 XP today for Merchant Seller. He fell asleep.</p>
<p>He woke up and went back to work.</p>
<p>He noticed that his status page looked more decorated like one of those nostalgic phone charms they put on flip phones or those old GIF-riddled personal websites back in the late 2000s.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t really know what to do with the other skills.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t really planning on going outside and doing tricks.</p>
<p>But he was thinking of going the completionist route.</p>
<p>Maybe, the [System] will reward him.</p>
<p>He looked for a door to lock-pick, using his fingers for now.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>He tried it again with a small tiny stick.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>He asked Albatross for a lock pick.</p>

<p>He went around and asked for something that was as small as a nail.</p>
<p>Someone gave him an actual nail.</p>
<p>He tried lock-picking a random door with a nail.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work either.</p>
<p>Stumped, he decided to go back rolling.</p>

<p>15 days maybe.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know how to count.</p>
<p>He tried the other skills he had. He had Crafting I, Necromantic Energy Manipulation I, Business Management I, Enchantment I, Merchantry I, Friendship Building I, Exploration I, Disguise I, Lightning Strike I, Herbalism I, Animal Communication I, Night Vision I, and Lockpicking I.</p>
<p>He tried Crafting, grabbing sticks and putting them together.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>He tried making a pickaxe by combining sticks and wood planks that he got by buying it from a lumber shop with money from Albatross.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much, but it would do for now.</p>
<p><strong>Merchant Seller (3.5/100 XP) -&gt; Merchant Seller (4/100 XP)</strong>**</p>
<p>He was told by Albatross that the Customers were less today and that he would have to find something else to do in the meantime. However, he did say that he could do something new. He told him that if he went down the road, he would find a plant-master, she would teach him how to take care of plants.</p>
<p>Santo was disappointed, because he wanted to keep making pickaxes. For now, he was thinking of exploring new avenues.</p>
<p>He decided to take up Albatross&rsquo; suggestion and head down the road to the plant-master.</p>
<p>When he was there, he didn&rsquo;t see static plants that barely moved. He saw a bunch of plants fighting each other on the floor.</p>
<p>The plant-master, who he expected to be either an older woman or man, was a woman as young as he was, and she was cheering for both sides of a plant fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Santo said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plant-master stopped him with a gesture and said: &ldquo;Watch! Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo looked at the plants. He saw that the plants were fighting and doing various different martial arts techniques. Their hands, arms, and legs, and body shape shifted around in rotation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just two weeks, I was able to get them to do this. Cool right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool? They suddenly became like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. That has been the case since my great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother. But I&rsquo;ve finally updated them so that they do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The martial arts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kicking and moving their arms and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s &lsquo;martial arts&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cool. I&rsquo;ll call it that then. The &lsquo;Martial Arts Update&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what are their uses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nothing much yet, but we&rsquo;re a bunch of researchers first and foremost. And with the possibility of war, I feel that it is only right that we find new ways to make them stronger right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the case for a long time?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the worry of war that long ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Santo left, not wanting to get too deep into the politics.</p>
<p>The chance at getting to learn more about the plant-master and her plants was lost in the process however, but Santo saw it as a worthy sacrifice.</p>
<p>He returned to Merchant Albatross, who said, &ldquo;Good thing you&rsquo;re here! I&rsquo;ve been meaning to call you because we&rsquo;re having Customers again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo nodded, and they began their great work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s enough, Santo,&rdquo; Merchant Albatross said. &ldquo;Good work!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Merchant Seller (4/100 XP) -&gt; Merchant Seller (10/100 XP)</strong>**</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was good progress,&rdquo; said Santo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that was good. Okay! Goodbye now Albatross!&rdquo; Albatross hurried him out.</p>
<p>Santo sat down at a public bench. &ldquo;This feels nice. I can do this forever. Maybe, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, several tall men wearing purple-and-yellow clothes passed by.</p>
<p>Santo tried not to stare at them, but he couldn&rsquo;t help glancing at them through his peripheral view.</p>
<p>The tall men passed by, bringing the air of monsters higher than he could never reach with them.</p>
<p>Santo shrugged and stood up, stretching a bit.</p>
<p>A giant market stood in front of him in the form of a large public crowd. If he could set up a shop here, then maybe lots of people would buy. He wondered why no one set up shop here. Maybe the city were strict against street vendors here.</p>
<p>He returned home and slept at the time he wanted.</p>
<p>He woke up the next day and immediately arrived at the shop before Merchant Albatross.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was early, Albatross later said that he was proud of his hard worker.</p>
<p>Santo smiled, though he didn&rsquo;t take the compliment too hard.</p>
<p>He planned on working through today to buy some pickaxes later.</p>

<p>Santo raised his brows. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wanted to ask Albatross about it, but he didn&rsquo;t know where Albatross lived.</p>
<p>So he asked around.</p>
<p>People told him that it was 2 hours away on foot at the inner portion of the city.</p>
<p>Santo began running.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Worker (Claim 30 XP on sign up at Crafter&rsquo;s Guild; 1:59:43)</strong></p>
<p>His feet began to ache. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a runner&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always been a programmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around and asked for a wagon, but no one helped him because he didn&rsquo;t have money.</p>
<p>He decided to keep running anyway.</p>
<p>The emotions that he had held inside burst in fervor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take this!&rdquo; he muttered as he ran around a corner.</p>
<p>The guards began glancing at him. Bystanders and passersby&rsquo;s eyes detected him and moved out of the way.</p>
<p>He was catching attention, but he had to hurry.</p>

<p>He was already one-third of the way there.</p>
<p>He was this close.</p>
<p>He burst into another sprint, his lungs aching.</p>
<p>The city saw him., and he became an object of fascination.</p>
<p>A large crowd blocked his path, but he soldiered through, excusing himself in rapid fire.</p>
<p>Then, a line of wagons blocked his path.</p>
<p>He wanted to stop, so he did, resting his legs. &ldquo;Dangit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once the wagons had an opening, he went through and dashed forward.</p>
<p>The people stared at him.</p>
<p>His feet struck the earth; his hands reached forward.</p>
<p>He flew almost.</p>
<p>He was on cloud nine: the Craftmen&rsquo;s Guild was right in the distance.</p>
<p>He hurried his tiny steps before tripping.</p>
<p>He caught himself before getting up again.</p>
<p>He would not let this reward go to waste.</p>

<p>This chapter will go against my earlier statements that hinted at a purely light-hearted story, but the goal is still to explore this story using the premise as gospel.</p>
<p>Santo returned to Merchant Albatross, who waved at him. &ldquo;Come here, come here,&rdquo; Albatross said, showing him a bunch of crates. &ldquo;These are special. Come on look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo saw a bunch of ducks inside. &ldquo;What are they for?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re golden ducks! They give lots of gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;re supposed to be golden geese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, look.&rdquo; Albatross showed him a golden hoe. &ldquo;They pooped this out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ew. But how did they do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;s awesome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though he didn&rsquo;t want to get too involved with shifting responsibilities, Santo was slowly improving.</p>
<p>He noticed several dogs walking around, and none in the town looked with disapproval at them.</p>
<p>He was surprised. He had never seen stray dogs walking around where he lived back on Earth. They were always brought away immediately, so it was a rare once-a-year event when he was growing up.</p>
<p>He grew up in a gated community where many of the wealthy and famous lived, so he never knew the plights and friendships everyday people made with dogs.</p>
<p>But since he was here, why not?</p>
<p>He approached one of the dogs, but they bit him.</p>
<p>The dogs were rageful, and he could see that.</p>
<p>He felt empathy, because he knew that these dogs had suffered long and hard for them to be so aggressive, given that they were street dogs.</p>
<p>He told them that it was okay and left. He didn&rsquo;t need to win.</p>
<p>He only needed to prepare for what would come next, because underlying the joys of everyday life was the heavy hammer of fate.</p>
<p>Later, nearby, roars poured through the streets, as hundreds of soldiers began employing the houses and buildings to use as housing.</p>
<p>Even if they were the town&rsquo;s soldiers, they were heading to war.</p>
<p>Returning to Santo, he didn&rsquo;t really want to deal with that, so he hid inside the Albatross&rsquo; shop and told Albatross what they could do.</p>
<p>Albatross said he wanted to go out and do something and that if Santo wanted to hide, he could do so at his &ldquo;own risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo nodded.</p>
<p>After 10 hours passed, nothing happened, and Santo had gotten bored and fallen asleep.</p>
<p>When he woke up, his back ached. He had never slept that long, and it was probably because of how comfy Albatross&rsquo; bed was.</p>
<p>He had been sleeping on the bed inside the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what are we going to do next?&rdquo; he wanted to ask Albatross.</p>
<p>But Albatross was not there. The soldiers were still outside in formation.</p>
<p>Santo shrugged. It was late afternoon already, but he was still up to sell.</p>
<p><strong>[The Customer wants to buy from you. Roll a dice to get a number either 5 or below! The number you get will the price that customer asks. For context, it&rsquo;s between numbers 1 to 50.]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[No.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Customer wants to buy from you. Roll a dice to get a number either 5 or below! The number you get will the price that customer asks. For context, it&rsquo;s between numbers 1 to 50.]</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is good enough,&rdquo; he said to the customers as he closed the shop, telling them that they would get an exclusive discount for waiting anyway.</p>
<p>He was actually going to get out of his own money this time. Why did he do this?</p>
<p>Well, he saw a mother and child, a youth that looked troubled and stressed, and a group of farmers that were talking to each other and waiting patiently only to get declined when the time came for them to buy.</p>
<p>He felt sorry for them, but this was also his way of bringing back some good to the community and cultivating loyalty. If the 14 customers who were declined bought twice more, then that could lead 100% increase in sales, considering that they got 100 customers everyday and the discount was 50%. Well, they didn&rsquo;t all buy the same items, and not all the items had the same price. Therefore, his calculation was likely off by a lot; however, it was a good way to see the sales trajectory for deceivingly simple actions.</p>
<p>He was a senior coder after all. It was his job to know suboptimal ways of getting the same result in order to teach juniors the optimal way. And what better way to start applying this concept by gauging a sales trajectory? His coding skills were not useless outside coding after all, he thought jokingly.</p>
<p>The next day, he saw Albatross at the shop again, but for some reason, the good dude looked distressed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Santo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took my wife and kids away,&rdquo; Albatross said with a grave voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Santo, who had been thinking about irrational coding and numbers earlier. &ldquo;No way. That doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s what they did okay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay then. I guess soldiers do that? What&rsquo;s the logic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I don&rsquo;t know! I&rsquo;m thinking of doing it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing&hellip; what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to end it all—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, don&rsquo;t say that. Is it a normal thing? What&rsquo;s their basis? Is there some law or what? There must be a reason why they&rsquo;re doing this. I&rsquo;ve never seen soldiers do bad things before. They&rsquo;ve always been protecting me.&rdquo; He was referring to his life back on Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell are you talking about?&rdquo; Albatross was visibly enraged. &ldquo;Stop saying this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&hellip; you&rsquo;re not making sense. I thought you had it altogether. But you look lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I look lost! What are you? A noble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo felt offended. &ldquo;No&hellip; not necessarily—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shut up okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo hated being looked down like this. Just because he had it easy didn&rsquo;t mean he had it easy. Things were difficult for him too, and Albatross was being unreasonable. Santo was calm because he knew how to be patient, but Albatross was being very unreasonable.</p>
<p>Santo decided to leave.</p>
<p><strong>[Acquaintance-maker -60 XP!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acquaintance-maker (4.75/100 XP) -&gt; Acquaintance-maker (-55.25/100 XP)</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You have lost Acquaintance-maker! You will not be able to gain it back in 55.25 days as a penalty!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Due to losing Acquaintance-maker, you will also get Callousness, reducing empathy by 60%!]</strong></p>
<p>He made sure to bring nothing. He could have sold the pickaxes, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to. And he was too frustrated to try while Albatross was still there.</p>
<p>His pride was hurt, but he had a good reason okay?</p>
<p>He decided to travel. He didn&rsquo;t need entitled toxic people who thought they could get whatever they wanted. People needed to work hard for what they wanted, and Albatross was clearly one of those people who blamed others instead of owning up for what they did wrong—victim mentality. The soldiers would never hurt anyone unless it was for a reason. What was the logic in kidnapping a wife and a child? Albatross and his wife did something wrong.</p>
<p>Returning to the moment, though he was bothered, he still had his golden handknife to protect his items in case he needed to.</p>
<p>But it was one-time use, so he had to be careful.</p>
<p>He planned to keep working as a merchant, since it was clearly a good way to accrue XP in a safe way. He didn&rsquo;t want to get entangled with politics or <em>unreasonable people</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a familiar wizard encountered him, casting: &ldquo;[No Man Nor Beast Shall Ever Through These Lands Ever Again]!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t learned your lesson, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spell hurt him this time, because he was using his human disguise.</p>
<p>He fell to the ground hard, his head dizzy and nauseous. &ldquo;What&hellip; what was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, you should have killed me when you had the choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Chance&rsquo;, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santo was only pretending to be weak. He struck the wizard on the head and knocked him to the ground, controlling him with his boney body. He removed his disguise, revealing the skeleton underneath. &ldquo;You and that other guy are the same kind!&rdquo; he shouted, scaring the wizard due to the deep, monstrous voice.</p>
<p>The wizard was left alive, but he was too frozen to do anything, tears dripping down his face and repeating &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; with closed eyes.</p>
<p>Santo was not any ordinary man.</p>
<p>He was&hellip; a skeleton.</p>
<p>He returned and asked the man how he could set up a stall for people to buy, still using his intimidating voice.</p>
<p>The man nodded and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a spot around here. It&rsquo;s called Don&rsquo;s Way, and if you stay there, many adventurers will come, I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I promise&rsquo;? That sounds not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise, I promise—I&rsquo;m being real, I&rsquo;m being real!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay then. Where&rsquo;s the way? What direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed south. &ldquo;&hellip;there&hellip;&rdquo; His hand pointed toward a mountain range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I get there huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ridges are Don&rsquo;s Way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you want me to die, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I&rsquo;m just saying that I can lead you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? There?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I know the path, and since you&rsquo;re strong and pretty human too, I thought we can work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Really</em>?&rdquo; He glared at the man in case he was lying.</p>
<p>Santo returned to normal: &ldquo;Then, let&rsquo;s go. I want to set up a merchant stall now. What&rsquo;s a good meal to make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, bibingka. I heard people buy it. Cheese sticks as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmh. Sounds pretty good.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t make facial expressions, but if he could, he would be smiling until the corners of his lips reached his ears.</p>
<p>The wizard stood up with his staff and then fell, slamming his head against the dirt due to a tree root.</p>
<p>Santo furrowed his brow, frowning. As the wizard pretended to be unconscious, Santo&rsquo;s face slowed changed, a smile appearing, before he burst into gleeful laughter.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because of his responsibilities in this new world, but he couldn&rsquo;t just play around like a child anymore.</p>
<p>He was going to take this world on, and if he had to team up with old enemies, then so be it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in Santo&rsquo;s hand, the book had been quiet for a while, but it was listening the whole time.</p>
<p>Something sparked in its heart. Unlike many pets, it longed to become more. Like the Fallen Angel, it envied God&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>The book wanted to conquer Santo&rsquo;s position. Their friendship, albeit short, had been sweet, but it would come to an end and make the way for a new dynamic, one shared by two different points of view.</p>
<p>Santo stood; the book stayed tucked in his hand; and the wizard stood up, sauntering feebly behind Santo.</p>
<p>When they reached Don&rsquo;s Way, Santo waited for a while, and they didn&rsquo;t find anyone at first.</p>
<p>But with time, adventurers began coming. The wizard was right.</p>
<p>The book began walking around nearby, lying down next to a rock. Santo warned it about the elements as per usual. But the book didn&rsquo;t like anything that Santo said, only complying outwardly.</p>
<p>And that was when Santo began selling nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to sell. I forgot my stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shoot, you went all the way here and forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of getting frustrated like Albatross, he laughed it off. &ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;re going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wizard stood still, watching Santo walk back silently. A lot of emotions hid behind that contemplative and considerating look of his.</p>
<p>The book jumped in Santo&rsquo;s hand, and the three went on their way back home.</p>
<p>Later, they brought Santo&rsquo;s older pickaxes and prepared to sell them.</p>
